This is the main code used to experiment on the topics of SINDy algorithms and NN for dynamics prediction, 
related to the exam of DATA ANALYTICS FOR MECHANICAL SYSTEMS, yr. 2022/2023.
The code analyses in different manners the Lorenz Chaotic system, implementing PySINDY and a simple NN for dynamics learning.

Code related to PySINDy Python package, available at https://github.com/dynamicslab.
